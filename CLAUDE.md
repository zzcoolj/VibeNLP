# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VibeNLP is a new NLP project. The codebase is currently being initialized.

## Language Requirements

### Student-Facing Files (需要双语的文件)

**Important**: Only student-facing files (such as exercises) require bilingual support in **English and French**.

- Bilingual files must be **separate**: create one file for French (fr) and one for English (en)
- Example file structure:
  - `exercises/exercise1_fr.md` (French version)
  - `exercises/exercise1_en.md` (English version)

### Internal/Preparation Files (内部准备文件)

Files used for course preparation (such as "idea" files) can be written in **Chinese** with **English technical terms**.

- Use Chinese for general content and explanations
- Use English for technical vocabulary and terminology
- Example:
  ```python
  # 这个function用来process input data
  def process_data(input_data):
      # 使用transformer model进行处理
      pass
  ```

## Development Setup

*To be added once the project structure is established.*

## Build and Test Commands

*To be added once build tools are configured.*

## Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase develops.*
