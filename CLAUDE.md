# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VibeNLP is a new NLP project. The codebase is currently being initialized.

## Language Requirements

### Bilingual Files (中法双语文件)

**Important**: The following files require **Chinese and French** bilingual versions:
- All `.md` files in the root directory (except `CLAUDE.md`)
- All files in the `exercises/` folder

**File naming convention**:
- Chinese version: `filename_cn.md` (e.g., `COURSE_IDEAS_cn.md`)
- French version: `filename_fr.md` (e.g., `COURSE_IDEAS_fr.md`)

**Synchronization rule**: When the Chinese version is modified, the corresponding French version must be updated accordingly.

Example file structure:
- `COURSE_IDEAS_cn.md` (Chinese version)
- `COURSE_IDEAS_fr.md` (French version)
- `exercises/TP1-GitHub-Claude-Code-Setup_cn.md` (Chinese version)
- `exercises/TP1-GitHub-Claude-Code-Setup_fr.md` (French version)

### Internal Files (内部文件)

`CLAUDE.md` is an internal configuration file and does not require translation.

## Development Setup

*To be added once the project structure is established.*

## Build and Test Commands

*To be added once build tools are configured.*

## Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase develops.*
